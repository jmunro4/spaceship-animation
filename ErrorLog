Issue #1:
Cylinder object does not display with the background on.

Update:
	(Theory) Is it possible the texture mapping code has colored the cylinder the same color as the background, and we can't see it in the display window?

	Update: The above proposed theory is correct, the cylinder has been mapped along with the background.

Solved: 
	glDisable(TEXTURE_MAPPING_2D) before drawing the cylinder.


Issue #2:
Everytime glutPostRedisplay the window goes white
-needed to reenable 2d textures for the background (Weaver)

Ship texture moves
- disable auto generate coords

ship texture looks awful
remap coords?
	Fixed
	Stray Line of texture code was removed

SegFault
	Program would only run with GDB and not as a standalone exe
	Other stray line of code was trying to apply texture improperly

Problem:
	Lasers are supposed to spawn light sources positioned just above each laser object, but lights are absent.

	Current lighting code is inside lazer.h, but lights do not appear.

Resolved:
	Needed glDisable(GL_TEXTURE_2D);
